								<h2>What separates our system from the standard in-person coaching experience?</h2>
								<p>Each professional athlete working at Pros Know Best has extensive experience in
								coaching young athletes in 1 on 1 settings. After consulting with many professional
								athletes, we discovered that the biggest flaw that follows 1 on 1 coaching with young
								athletes is their failure to absorb and retain all of the information being taught to
								them during a lesson. There are a multitude of reasons that can lead to this loss of
								information - including - the young athlete's attention span (or lack thereof) and the
								fact that sometimes too many concepts are taught in too short of a lesson. 
								We do not suggest our product should replace in-person lessons, but instead it should
								offer a supplemental, yet very important form of development. </p>
								
								<h2>Why is this an essential in-season resource?</h2>
								<p>We believe our system is as valuable if not more valuable
								to a player's development in-season than in the offseason.
								The biggest separation between the two seasons is the presence
								of organized practices and live games during the spring and
								summer seasons. Young players, especially little leaguers, have
								practices and games nearly everyday for nearly 4-5 months during
								this season. Parents and players do not have the time to schedule,
								drive to, and sit through hour-long private lessons during this busy season. 
								Our product steps in to eliminate this time consumption by giving
								players and parents a wealth of personalized coaching knowledge on
								their computer or phone screens. Players can then take the tips and
								drills then learn and use them at their practices and games everyday. </p>
								
								<h2>Are there any players who would not be good candidates for the coaching of your program?</h2>
								<p>Absolutely not! Our coaches are trained to identify the skill level of every player from
								the video provided and will adapt their analysis and drills to that skill level accordingly.
								We prefer to work with athletes between the ages 8-18, because we believe it is an age range
								that can benefit most from our coaching. </p>
								
								<h2>Can you justify the pricing of your service?</h2>
								<p>An hour-long lesson with a coach at a baseball training facility can cost
								between $70-$100. Many players will even take these hour-long lessons once a week.
								We firmly believe that if a player continuously uses the coaching and drills
								provided in our analysis package over a month's time, they will advance as much,
								if not more, than they would from 4 lessons (which can cost around $350-400!)</p>
								
								<h2>Do you believe that your analysis service should completely replace in-person lessons?</h2>
								<p>No way! As professional athletes who still thrive on learning more and getting better,
								we value the importance of in-person coaching. In fact, every one of our pros give lessons to
								players in their area during our offseason. Our service serves as the perfect compliment to
								lessons, because we provide players and parents with the tools needed to continually get better
								outside of lessons.</p>
								
								<h2>Can you Request Analysis for Multiple Skills/Positions? (i.e. Pitching & Hitting)</h2>
								<p>Of course! We would be happy to help you improve in any and every area of your game,
								but each analysis only covers one particular skill. Therefore, you must request another
								analysis for the other skill you would like us to help evolve.</p>
